# Hypothesis Testing - Null Hypothesis

**Objective**: Implement a null hypothesis test to study the relative effect on house prices of university and non-university regions of USA in recession.

**Hypothesis**: University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions. Run a t-test to compare the ratio of the mean price of houses in university towns the quarter before the recession starts compared to the recession bottom. (`price_ratio=quarter_before_recession/recession_bottom`)

**Conclusion**: Since the p-value is less then the threshold p-value of 0.01, so we reject the null hypothesis and concludes that ***University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions.***
